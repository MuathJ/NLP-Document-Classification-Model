An Upper East Side mansion that was home to the Broadway producers Howard and Janet Kagan for the last decade finally sold after more than a year on the market and a hefty price reduction.

The elegant limestone structure, at 11 East 82nd Street, was acquired by an anonymous buyer for $30.1 million, making it New York City’s most expensive closing in March. The Kagans, whose productions include “Tuck Everlasting” and the revival of “Pippin,” bought the late-1890s house in 2009 for $24.5 million, then undertook a top-to-bottom renovation. When they put the 22-room home back on the market in 2017, they initially sought $44 million.

This wasn’t the only spruced-up townhouse to sell at a big discount last month. In Greenwich Village, a carriage house at 23 Cornelia Street, where the pop star Taylor Swift once lived, closed at $11.5 million, less than half its original $24.5 million price from two years ago.

A few blocks away, at the Greenwich Lane complex, a new townhouse fared better, selling for almost $22 million, nearer to its $25 million price tag.

Among the other notable March closings were four apartments at 220 Central Park South, each for more than $20 million, including two three-bedroom units, on the 40th and 41st floors, which sold for around $23.4 million apiece. The luxury high-rise set the national record for the highest price paid for a single residence — $240 million for a four-level unit — in February.

Elsewhere on the Upper East Side, Lawrence Herbert, the creator of the Pantone Color Matching System, sold his full-floor co-op at 778 Park Avenue, and at neighboring 740 Park, a longtime resident sold his duplex. Also, two apartments at the Plaza Residences at 1 Central Park South closed.
