Starting and building a business is like sailing a ship, said Pavlo Phitidis, founder of Aurik Business Accelerator, in an interview with Bruce Whitfield on The Money Show.

He took the analogy further:

You build the kind of boat you need to perform certain types of tasks.

You set out to sail to a specific destination.

You need to resource your ship to sustain the journey.

You have different parts of the ship performing different functions - stern, mid-ship and bow.

You have a crew.

You have an engine room and a bridge.
Using this analogy, said Phitidis, is a profound way to simplify what you do and how you need to build your business so that it reaches its destination successfully.
